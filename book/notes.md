## Cargo
* A crate is a collection of Rust source code files
* Running `cargo doc --open` will build the documentation provided by all of your dependencies (locally) and open it in the browser [[ch02-00](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number)]

## Functions
* The `::` syntax in `::new` indicates that `new` is an *associated function* of the `String` type:
  ```rust
    String::new()
  ```
* An *associated function* is implemented on a type, rather than on a particular instance of the type. Some languages call this a *static method* [[ch02-00](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#storing-values-with-variables)]
* Function bodies are made up of a series of *statements* optionally ending in an *expression* [[ch03-03](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#function-bodies-contain-statements-and-expressions)]
* *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value
* Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value.

## Enums
* The values of an enum(eration) are called *variants* [[ch02-00](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)]

## Match
* A `match` expression is made up of *arms*, which consists of a *pattern* and the code to be run if the value fits that arm's pattern [[ch02-00](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number)]

## Types
* The `isize` and `usize` types size depend on the computer architecture (i.e. 64-bit or 32-bit)
* Signed integer types are stored using two's complement notation [[ch03-03](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-types)]
* In debug mode, Rust checks for integer overflow and causes the program to *panic* at runtime if it occurs
* In `--release` mode, Rust does **not** include checks, instead, it will perform two's complement wrapping
* If you want values to "wrap around" you should be explicit, by using the standard library type [`Wrapping`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.Wrapping.html)
* The `char` type is four bytes in size and represents Unicode Scalar Value, which range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive [[ch03-03](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-character-type)]
* *Tuples* have fixed length and can contain values of different types [[ch03-02](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type)]
* *Arrays* have fixed length but all its elements must have the same type, they're useful to allocate data on the stack or to ensure that you always have a fixed number of elements [[ch03-02](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-array-type)]
* Rust checks for (and *panics* on) out of bounds indices for arrays [[ch03-02](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#invalid-array-element-access)]

## Control Flow
* A `loop` block can return a value by placing it after a `break` expression [[ch03-05](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#returning-values-from-loops)]:
  ```rust
    let mut counter = 0;
    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;
        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
  ```
* Simple `for` loop examples [[ch03-05](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for)]:
  ```rust
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }

    // (1..4) is a `Range`, and `rev` reverses it
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
  ```
